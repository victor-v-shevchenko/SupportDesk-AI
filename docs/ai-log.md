## 2026-10-31 — Waiting for the startup lock timed out after 30 seconds
- Step: 2
- Found by: review subagent
- What was wrong: the `pg_advisory_lock` call used Npgsql's default 30-second command timeout, so an instance waiting behind a slow first migration would still fail to start.
- Fix: the lock call has no command timeout; cancellation still comes from `ApplicationStopping` (step 2 PR).
- Test: none; a test would have to hold the lock for over 30 seconds in CI. `SeedingTests.Two_instances_starting_at_once_seed_once_without_failing` covers the lock itself

## 2026-10-31 — Malformed ticket body returned 500 in Development
- Step: 2
- Found by: review subagent
- What was wrong: Minimal APIs throw `BadHttpRequestException` for an unreadable body in Development, and the exception handler turned it into a `500` instead of a `400`.
- Fix: `ExceptionHandlerOptions.StatusCodeSelector` keeps that exception's status code (step 2 PR).
- Test: `TicketEndpointTests.Create_returns_400_problem_details_for_a_body_that_is_not_a_ticket`

## 2026-10-31 — Two instances starting together crashed on migration
- Step: 2 (the migration race dates from step 1)
- Found by: review subagent
- What was wrong: two API instances starting against one empty database both ran the migrations, and one failed with `relation "ticket_numbers" already exists`; seeding had the same race on the unique ticket number.
- Fix: migrations and seeding run under one PostgreSQL advisory lock in `MigrateAndSeedSupportDeskDatabaseAsync` (step 2 PR).
- Test: `SeedingTests.Two_instances_starting_at_once_seed_once_without_failing`

## 2026-10-31 — Created ticket's timestamp differed from the stored one
- Step: 2
- Found by: test
- What was wrong: `POST /api/tickets` returned `createdAt` with .NET's 100 ns precision, but PostgreSQL keeps microseconds, so a later `GET` of the same ticket returned a slightly different time.
- Fix: `TicketRepository` truncates `CreatedAt` to microseconds before saving (step 2 PR).
- Test: `TicketEndpointTests.Create_returns_201_with_location_and_the_ticket_is_listed_first`
